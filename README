=== Welcome to C(ontinued)-MaNGOS ===

C(ontinued)-MaNGOS is a project with the goal:

            Doing WoW-Emulation Right!

This means, we want to focus on:

* WoW-Emulation:
    This project is about developing a server software to be able to
    emulate some well known MMORPG service

* Doing:
  - This project is focused about developing content!
  - Also there are many more aspects that need to be done and are
    considered equally important.
    So anybody who wants to do stuff is very welcome to do so!

* Right:
  - Our goal always must be to provide the best code we can
  - Being 'right' is defined by the behavior of the system
    we want to emulate
  - Developing things right also contains documenting and discussing
    _how_ to do things better, hence
  - Learning and Teaching are very important in our view, and must
    always be part of what we do.

To be able to provide for these goals, we assert:

* Freedom
  - for our developers and contributers on things that interest them.
    No one here is telling anybody _what_ to do.
    If you want somebody to do something for you, pay him,
    but we are here to enjoy.
  - to have FUN with developing.

* A friendly environment
  - we try to let personal issues behind us
  - we only argue about content, and not about thin air!
  - we follow the Netiquette <insert link when found>

Documentation can be found in the doc/ subdirectory.
